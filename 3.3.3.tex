\levelstay{Problem 3.3.2}

\leveldown{Problem}

This is a slightly harder problem.
Instead of the very specific decaying exponential form in Eq.~(3.18), suppose you are given only that
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\baravg{\eta(t_1)\eta(t_2)}$ is a function of $\abs{t_1-t_2}$, the magnitude of the difference between the two time arguments; and further,
  \item $\baravg{\eta(t_1)\eta(t_2)}$ tends to zero as $\abs{t_1 - t_2} \rightarrow \infty$.
\end{itemize}
Show that the inescapable conclusion based on these properties is that $\baravg{v^2(t)}$ increases linearly with $t$ at long times, in the absence of $\gamma$.

\levelstay{Solution}

Denote $K(\abs{t_1 - t_2}) \equiv \baravg{\eta(t_1)\eta(t_2)}$.
In the absence of friction, the Lengevin equation reads
\begin{equation*}
  \baravg{v(t)^2} = \frac{1}{m^2} \int_0^t dt_1 \int_0^t dt_2 K(\abs{t_1 - t_2}) \, .
\end{equation*}
Figure~\ref{fig:3.3.3} illustrates our strategy for doing the integral.
\begin{align*}
  m^2 \baravg{v(t)^2}
  &= \int_0^t dt_1 \int_0^t dt_2 K(\abs{t_1 - t_2}) \\
  \text{(by symmetry)} \qquad &= 4 \int_\text{(blue region)} K(\abs{t_1 - t_2}) \\
  \text{(by symmetry again)} \qquad &= 2 \int_\text{(blue + red regions)} K(\abs{t_1 - t_2}) \\
  &= 2 \int_{q=0}^{\sqrt{2}t} dq \int_{p=0}^{\sqrt{2}t}dp  K(p) \, .
\end{align*}
The assumption that $\lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} K(p) = 0$ actually isn't enough to make progress.
For example, if $K(p) \propto 1/p$ the second integral doesn't even converge.
I think we have to assume that the integral of $K$ converges in the following sense: there is a value $\tau K^*$ such that for any $\epsilon$ there is a time $T$ such that $\abs{\int_0^t dp \, K(p) - K^*} < \epsilon$ for any $t > T$.
In other words, beyond a certain correlation time $\tau$, the correlation function $K$ contains negligible weight.
If this is the case then we can always take $t$ to be large enough such that $\int_0^t dp \, K(p) \approx K^*$ and therefore
\begin{equation*}
  m^2 \baravg{v(t)^2} = 2 \tau K^* \int_{q=0}^{\sqrt{2} t} dq = 2 \tau K^* \sqrt{2} t
  \, .
\end{equation*}
